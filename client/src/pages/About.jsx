        <p>
          The Ann Arbor District Library is proud to be the longest running
          esports tournament host in the area! We have been hosting in person
          gaming tournaments since 2004 and have not stopped since. We began
          running Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash tournaments
          in the Downtown multi-purpose room and broadcasting our matches on CTN.
          Now, we host events at every branch, running competitive tournaments,
          casual open plays, and broadcasting our matches to Twitch.tv to
          promote our participants accomplishments!
